roll20 API scripts and macros

API scripts may be found in the api directory. The 1-Utilities.js should be installed before any other scripts.
If other scripts require an ordering, they will be given a numeric prefix as well, such as 2-Somescript.js. You should
install all scripts with numeric prefixes in order before any other optional script.

Macros may be found in the macros directory. At this time, there aren't any, but that may change in the future.
